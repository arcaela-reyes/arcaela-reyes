# About Me

ðŸ‘‹ My name is Alejandro Reyes, I live in Venezuela,
Currently I do not belong to any company and for this reason I have dedicated my time to develop software for Everyone on Earth â™¥.

Iâ€™m the maintainer of [arcaela.js](https://github.com/arcaela/arcaela) and I contribute to multiple projects of others developers.
I also work on a number of other open source projects, mostly in the JavaScript and TypeScript ecosystems.

If you are interested in supporting any of my open source work I encourage you to sponsor me on [GitHub](https://github.com/sponsors/arcaela).

## Goals for 2021

- Write some web site for my self
- Release arcaela.js 2.0
- Contribute to more open source projects that I use. I want to contribute to all the main parts of my tech stack.
- ~Travel more and visit friends I've made through open source in Medellin, San Antonio (CL),  Madrid (ES), and Mars (Planet)~ ðŸ˜ž
